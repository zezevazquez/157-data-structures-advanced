# 157-data-structures-advanced
Hashtable(using a LinkedList for collision chaining), Binary Search Tree, and Directed Graph

## Setup and running tests
  1) Clone the repo to and cd to 157-data-structures-advanced
  2) Install dependencies by running `npm i` in terminal from project root directory
  3) Run `npm test` after dependencies installed to run tests

### Self Evaluation
According to specs below I am 10/17 complete, but overall I completed 1 out of the three Data Structures so far

# Core Data Structures [Advanced]

## Challenge Rating

This goal will likely be within your ZPD if you...

- Can write programs and tests using Node.js and npm
- Can use problem decomposition to split difficult problems into smaller parts
- Are familiar with the interfaces of core JavaScript objects: Object, Array, String, etc.
- Are interested in common data structures
- Are interested in critical thinking and problem solving

## Description

This is a sub-goal of [Core Data Structures][core-ds]. Reference that goal for more description, context, and resources.

Complete **ONLY** the [Advanced Data Structures][list-advanced-ds] from the list, not the [Basic][list-basic-ds]. That's a [separate goal][core-ds-basic]. :)
